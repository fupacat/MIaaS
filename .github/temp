Absolutely! Here’s a recommended collaborative workflow for MIaaS using GitHub features. We’ll work through each step together and adapt as needed.

## MIaaS Development Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Issue Tracking**
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, features, and tasks.
- Apply labels (`bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `question`, etc.).
- Link issues to the Kanban board for visual tracking.
- Assign issues to contributors or agents.

### 2. **Branching Strategy**
- Create a new branch for each issue/feature (e.g., `feature/node-registration`, `bug/fix-heartbeat`).
- Use descriptive branch names linked to issue numbers.

### 3. **Pull Requests**
- Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
- Reference the related issue in the PR description.
- Use the PR template for review checklist.
- Request review from team members or AI agents.
- CI runs automatically; fix any failed checks.

### 4. **Code Review & Merge**
- Review code, discuss changes, and approve PRs.
- Merge only after all checks pass and reviews are complete.
- Close related issues automatically via PR merge (`Closes #123`).

### 5. **Kanban Board Management**
- Move issues/PRs across columns (`To do`, `In progress`, `Done`).
- Regularly review and prioritize tasks.

### 6. **Documentation**
- Update README.md, Wiki, and GitHub Pages (docs) as features are added.
- Document major decisions in Discussions.

### 7. **Releases**
- Tag releases for major milestones (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`).
- Use the Releases tab to publish notes and artifacts.

### 8. **Dependency & Security**
- Dependabot runs weekly for updates and security alerts.
- Address alerts promptly.
